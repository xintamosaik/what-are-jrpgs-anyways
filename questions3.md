# Project Status Review
Based on your feedback, I understand this project is in a very early exploratory phase. Here's what I've gathered:

## Current Status
> - Basic Go server with /api/ping endpoint is implemented ✅
Yeah just to have an endpoint as an example
> - Project structure is flexible and will evolve
Aye
## Next Steps Focus
> 1. **React+Vite Frontend Setup** (immediate priority)
next, yes
> 2. Tileset upload/display functionality
after that I think. Maybe just dump a file for now and display that. Do upload later.
> 3. Map editor canvas implementation in React
That will be intersting

## Implementation Approach
> - Organizing by feature where possible
Exactly
> - Keeping schema and data formats flexible for now
Affirmative
> - Simple object storage approach for assets
Not very sure but that might be a good way for us
> - Drawing inspiration from RPG Maker with some Godot concepts
For now
## Questions for Consideration

As you move to the React+Vite implementation, some practical questions to consider:

> 1. Will the Go server need CORS configuration to work with the separate Vite dev server?
Probably. will see after vite is up
> 2. Should the Go server expose additional API endpoints specifically for the editor features?
Sounds sane. Yes for now.
3. Will you want a combined dev environment that starts both Go and Vite servers?
> Would be great. Can we?
 
> Would you like suggestions for setting up the React+Vite frontend as your next step? I could outline the basic structure or provide a simple implementation plan.
