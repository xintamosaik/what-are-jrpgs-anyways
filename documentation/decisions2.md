This is a solid architectural sketch, and you’re thinking about the right trade-offs. You already have a strong grasp of the shape of the system. Below is feedback structured into:

## 🔥 Immediate Priorities (This Week)

These will **set the tone** for coherence, extensibility, and packaging — exactly aligned with your XP-based approach:

### ✅ 1. **Runtime Bootstrapping**

* ✅ Create a Go binary that starts a local HTTP server
* ✅ Serve a static HTML+JS frontend that just says “hello world”
* ✅ Add a `/api/ping` endpoint for backend–frontend handshake

> 🎯 This lets you walk the talk: “The whole thing always runs.”

---

### ✅ 2. **Editor/Game Engine Split**

* Create two tabs or panels:

  * **Editor** → Shows a blank canvas + a sidebar (“Map Editor”)
  * **Game** → Shows a running game (just a canvas with a moving box)
* They can communicate via in-memory message passing (for now)

> 🎯 This gives you a visual, structural checkpoint: even empty, the *architecture exists*.

---

## 🔍 Tech Spikes (Next 1–2 Weeks)

Spikes are focused, time-boxed investigations into **high-risk unknowns**:

### 🔍 1. **Go Embed and Packaging**

* Embed static files (`go:embed`) in Go and confirm multi-platform builds
* Try compiling for Linux/Mac/Windows and test whether it “just works”

### 🔍 2. **Canvas Layering & Input**

* Prototype canvas layer manager:

  * Background, sprite, UI
  * Add zoom and selection to see where complexity creeps in

### 🔍 3. **Simple Save/Load Cycle**

* Create a minimal map in the editor (even 5×5 grid with tile IDs)
* Save to JSON and reload
* Verify you can hand off data between Editor → Game Runner → Backend

## 🧩 Safe to Defer

These are important but **can wait** without risk of structural damage:

* ❌ Quest editor (needs concept design first)
* ❌ Combat system
* ❌ NPC logic / scripting
* ❌ Visual programming interface
* ❌ Tile slicing / asset pipeline

These are **design-sensitive**, not architecture-sensitive yet.

---

## ❗ Risk Hotspots & Guidance

### ❗ 1. **Multiplayer Scope**

> You said “I want multiplayer. I’m not sure how.”

That’s okay — just **assume single-player** for now and isolate anything that touches game state so you can later replace:

* `state.localState` → becomes `state.syncAdapter`
* All input/output goes through a layer that could later support sync (WebSocket etc.)

---

### ❗ 2. **Plugin System**

> “Frontend yes, backend I would like to but don’t know how.”

Try using:

* **Dynamic frontend modules** via import maps or remote module loading
* **Backend plugins** = define Go interfaces early on, even if only implemented natively for now

Make plugin boundaries **clear**, even if there’s only one implementation for now.

---

### ❗ 3. **Sandboxing User JS**

> “Sandbox?”

This is critical. If you let users define JS scripts that run in the browser:

* Use a **JS interpreter like [@runvnc/quickjs](https://github.com/justjake/quickjs-emscripten)** or \[Nearley + JS AST eval]
* Avoid `eval` unless *strictly scoped* (e.g. no global access)
* Keep user code in Web Workers or iframes to isolate it

> Don’t block yourself here — just put all user code behind a single “evalThis(script, context)” stub for now.

## ✅ Final Advice for XP This Week

> 🎯 **Goal:** “An empty app + empty game that send hello to each other”

Here’s your first XP slice:

1. `go run` serves HTML/JS
2. Frontend loads, canvas visible
3. “Editor” and “Game” tabs render different canvases
4. JS sends “hello” to Go → Go logs and responds “hello back”
5. Log shows round-trip message complete

If you want, I can generate a **starter repo structure** for this XP slice (`cmd/main.go`, `ui/index.html`, etc.).

Shall we scaffold that?
