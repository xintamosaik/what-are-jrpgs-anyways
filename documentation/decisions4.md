You're on a great track — your approach is exploratory but grounded, and that’s exactly right for this kind of system. Let me now cleanly **synthesise your decisions and uncertainties** into a clarified action plan and address the open questions with minimal jargon.

## ✅ **Clarified Plan for XP Slice**

### 🔧 Setup

| Component    | Description                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `game.go`    | Serves the **game engine** (localhost:3001)             |
| `editor.go`  | Serves the **editor** (localhost:3000)                  |
| `ui/editor/` | HTML+JS canvas + sidebar                                |
| `ui/game/`   | HTML+JS canvas with moving shape                        |
| Comm         | Both apps talk to their respective backend via HTTP API |

> 🔁 This dual-port setup is fine. Long term, you can optionally unify under one Go binary using routes like `/editor` and `/game`.

### 🎯 **XP Goal Summary**

> *You should be able to run two Go binaries, open two tabs, and see a round-trip "hello" sent from JS to Go and back.*

Tasks:

1. [ ] `go run editor.go` → serves `localhost:3000`, HTML canvas + button → sends ping to backend → displays response
2. [ ] `go run game.go` → serves `localhost:3001`, shows different canvas → same ping cycle
3. [ ] Add dummy shared file (e.g. `shared/map.json`) that both backends read/write to

## ❗ Explaining the Open Points

### 🔁 Why "localState → syncAdapter" matters

That’s just a pattern name. What it *means* is:

> **Design your game logic (input, events, world changes) as if they’re networked**, even if they're not *yet*.

So, instead of:

```js
player.x += 1
```

Think:

```js
game.dispatch({ type: "MOVE", playerId: "p1", direction: "right" })
```

This **gives you multiplayer by design** later — because all actions can be:

* Logged
* Synced
* Replayed
* Sent to a server

You don’t need a real implementation now — just a **thin abstraction** that will *later* call WebSocket, but for now just updates local state.

> ✅ You're right: if you want multiplayer as default, design this early.

---

### 🔌 What’s a plugin boundary?

Imagine this:

```go
type CombatPlugin interface {
  HandleTurn(GameState) GameState
}
```

Even if you implement that logic directly, you now have a **named seam** in your architecture. Later you could:

* Load plugins via Go's plugin system
* Register custom behaviours per game

Frontend could do the same via:

```js
window.plugins['customScript'] = function (context) { ... }
```

You don’t need dynamic loading *now*, just **design seams**.

---

### 🧨 Why sandboxing came up

You said: *“Game designers will write JS that gets sent to the backend.”*

Here’s what this **implies**:

* That JS might later run *in the browser*, especially for preview
* Or be executed *on your backend*, as part of "play mode"

So:

* 🧠 If it runs on client → isolate it from the global environment using an iframe or Web Worker
* 🛡 If it runs on server → *don’t trust it* (it might have `while(true)` or `os.RemoveAll("/")`)

But! You can **ignore this** for now. Just run:

```js
eval(userScript)
```

with a TODO above it: *// TODO: sandbox this*

## ⚙️ Next Actions

### ✅ Minimal Starter Plan (0→1 XP)

1. Create two Go apps:

   * `editor.go` serves static files from `/ui/editor`
   * `game.go` serves static files from `/ui/game`
   * Each exposes `GET /api/ping` that returns JSON `{ "message": "pong" }`

2. JS in each app:

   * `button.onclick = () => fetch('/api/ping')...`
   * Result shown in DOM

3. Canvas:

   * Editor canvas draws a grid
   * Game canvas moves a square with arrow keys

> 💡 Want me to generate a ready-to-run folder structure with `go:embed`, basic UI, and a ping route?

Or would you prefer to sketch it yourself and check back for feedback?
