### ✅ 1. **Runtime Bootstrapping**

> Create a Go binary that starts a local HTTP server
    2 go binaries?
> Serve a static HTML+JS frontend that just says “hello world”
    buttons and recieving divs to send receive
> Add a `/api/ping` endpoint for backend–frontend handshake
    yeah


### ✅ 2. **Editor/Game Engine Split**

> Create two tabs or panels:

> **Editor** → Shows a blank canvas + a sidebar (“Map Editor”)
> **Game** → Shows a running game (just a canvas with a moving box)

They will communicate over the backends from the start. 


### 🔍 1. **Go Embed and Packaging**
> Embed static files (`go:embed`) in Go and confirm multi-platform builds. 
Intersting I did not now that 
> Try compiling for Linux/Mac/Windows and test whether it “just works”
aye

### 🔍 2. **Canvas Layering & Input**

> Prototype canvas layer manager:

> Background, sprite, UI
> Add zoom and selection to see where complexity creeps in
Good ideas

### 🔍 3. **Simple Save/Load Cycle**

> Create a minimal map in the editor (even 5×5 grid with tile IDs)
> Save to JSON and reload
Yeah. 
> Verify you can hand off data between Editor → Game Runner → Backend
The XP full cycle thing? Yeah, right!


## 🧩 Safe to Defer

> These are important but **can wait** without risk of structural damage:

> Quest editor (needs concept design first)
yes, later
> Combat system
yes, later
> NPC logic / scripting
yes, later
> Visual programming interface
yes, for sure. Later.
> Tile slicing / asset pipeline
This could be pretty next.


## ❗ Risk Hotspots & Guidance

### ❗ 1. **Multiplayer Scope**

>> You said “I want multiplayer. I’m not sure how.”

> That’s okay — just **assume single-player** for now and isolate anything that touches game state so you can later replace:
No. It will assume multiplayer as default. The other way around is less easy in my mind. 

> `state.localState` → becomes `state.syncAdapter`
I have no idea what that means.

> All input/output goes through a layer that could later support sync (WebSocket etc.)
I do not know why.

### ❗ 2. **Plugin System**

> “Frontend yes, backend I would like to but don’t know how.”

Try using:

> **Dynamic frontend modules** via import maps or remote module loading
No idea what that means.
> **Backend plugins** = define Go interfaces early on, even if only implemented natively for now
That sounds good. Not sure it is the solution but it is a pretty good first.

> Make plugin boundaries **clear**, even if there’s only one implementation for now.
That might be the way.

### ❗ 3. **Sandboxing User JS**

>> “Sandbox?”

> This is critical. If you let users define JS scripts that run in the browser:

> Use a **JS interpreter like [@runvnc/quickjs](https://github.com/justjake/quickjs-emscripten)** or \[Nearley + JS AST eval]
Why would I need that? The game designers would just write JS and it gets send to the backend and it will be part of the game then?
> Avoid `eval` unless *strictly scoped* (e.g. no global access)
Yeah ok. I did not consider it. 
> Keep user code in Web Workers or iframes to isolate it.
Why?

> Don’t block yourself here — just put all user code behind a single “evalThis(script, context)” stub for now.
I did not even know why I was blocked and I do not know why sandbox became a thing. I guess security and it might be a good call but I do not know what you imply here.


## ✅ Final Advice for XP This Week

>> 🎯 **Goal:** “An empty app + empty game that send hello to each other”

> Here’s your first XP slice:

> 1. `go run` serves HTML/JS
each its own port game/app?
> 2. Frontend loads, canvas visible
ok
> 3. “Editor” and “Game” tabs render different canvases
I was plannning different tabs and a possible version that has 2 iframes. Not sure.

> 4. JS sends “hello” to Go → Go logs and responds “hello back”
yaye
> 5. Log shows round-trip message complete
Yes
